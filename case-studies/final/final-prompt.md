# Final Project — CAP4767 Data Mining

**Assigned:** Week 6, Session 2
**Due:** Week 8 (present in class)
**Points:** 200

---

## The Scenario

You are now the analyst. No client, no prescribed dataset, no prescribed technique. You have eight weeks of data mining skills and a blank canvas.

Choose a domain that matters to you. Find a dataset. Ask a real question. Build the pipeline. Tell the story.

---

## Requirements

### Dataset
- Must not be used in any previous assignment in this course
- Must contain enough records to support meaningful analysis (minimum 1,000 rows recommended)
- **Optional:** Extend the domain you explored in the Week 7 individual lab — your dataset from that lab is a valid foundation

Get your dataset approved via Canvas before starting if you are unsure.

### Techniques
Apply a minimum of **three data mining techniques** from the course:
- At least **one predictive model** (logistic regression, neural network, or time-series forecast)
- At least **one clustering technique** (K-Means or equivalent)
- The third technique is your choice

### Deliverables

**1. Colab Notebook (80 points)**
Complete, documented pipeline from data loading through final insights. Every cell explained. Process documented — including what you tried that did not work.

**2. Business Memo (60 points)**
One to two pages. Addressed to a C-suite executive (CEO, CFO, or equivalent) at an organization relevant to your chosen domain. Translate your findings into decisions and dollars.

**3. Presentation (60 points)**
5–8 minutes. Hard stop at 8 minutes. Present to the class as if they are your stakeholder audience.

| **Memo — Executive clarity** (30 pts) | No jargon, specific recommendations, compelling | Mostly clear, minor technical language | Jargon-heavy or vague |
| | 30 | 20–22 | 8–10 |
| **Memo — Business impact & decisions** (30 pts) | Quantified, actionable, connected to real decisions | Some quantification, general direction | No numbers, no clear action |
| | 30 | 20–22 | 8–10 |

| **Presentation — Insight quality** (30 pts) | Genuine insight, real business relevance | Solid findings, partial business context | Descriptive only, no insight or business frame |
| | 30 | 20–22 | 8–10 |

**Total: 200 points**

> **The best final projects are not the most technically complex — they are the ones where the student clearly understood what they built, why it matters, and can explain it to anyone in the room.**
